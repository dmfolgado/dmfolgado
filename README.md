I am a Scientist at [Fraunhofer AICOS](https://www.aicos.fraunhofer.pt/en/home.html). My research focuses on knowledge extraction from time series using signal processing, machine learning, and deep learning techniques. I am also a PhD Student in Biomedical Engineering at FCT NOVA in the topic of Explainable Artificial Intelligence applied in healthcare.

I am a Python and time series analysis enthusiast! ðŸ”­ Check out my software projects:
